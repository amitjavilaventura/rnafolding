**rnafolding** is a package to...

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ruthkr/rnafolding")
```

<!-- ## Documentation -->

<!-- To use `rnafolding`, you can read the documentation on the following topics: -->

<!-- 1. [Getting started](https://ruthkr.github.io/rnafolding/articles/overview.html) -->

## Quick start

This is a basic example which shows you how to run windowed folding from a FASTA file:

```{r example}
# Load the package
library(rnafolding)

# Define the FASTA path from the sample 5S rRNA sequence
seq_5S <- system.file("extdata", "5S.fasta", package = "rnafolding")

# Fold 5S with Sliding Windows
windows_5S <- rnafolding::fold(
  filename = seq_5S,
  winsize = 50,
  stepsize = 5
)
```

After getting the windowed folding results, you can plot the structure map as follows:

```{r structure_map, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5, out.width='670px', out.height='300px', fig.align='center'}
plot_structure_map(
  windows_5S,
  plot_list = c("entropy", "bpp")
)
```

<!-- More examples with different input formats are available on functions documentations and vignettes, please refer to the [documentation](https://ruthkr.github.io/rnafolding). -->
